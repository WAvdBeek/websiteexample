IoTivity is an open source framework that implements the OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation) protocol for easy, secure device-to-device communication for IoT devices.

Each day more and more devices are coming online, adding to the ever-growing Internet of Things (IoT). Analysts agree the IoT will grow to many billions of devices over the next decade.

The challenge for the IoT ecosystem is to ensure these emerging IoT devices can connect securely and reliably to the Internet and to each other.

The IoTivity project was created to bring together the open source community to accelerate the development of the framework and services required to connect these billions of devices.

The IoTivity project is sponsored by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), a group of industry leaders that have created a standard specification and certification program to address these challenges.

IoTivity delivers an open source reference implementation of the OCF standard specifications.
